# road-crossing-game

the game is basically a naive attempt to replicate the road crossing games using python turtle module and oops, we first broke down the problem into four main parts :

1. designing the cars and controlling their random apperance with increasing speeds at each stage 
2. designing the player and restricting it's movement in the vertical line 
3. detecting the safe passage to the top and increasing the level
4. detecting the collision with some car 

one of my starting projects :)
